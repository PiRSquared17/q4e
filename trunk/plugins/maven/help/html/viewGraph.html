<h3>Viewing a Dependency Graph</h3>
</head>

<body>
<p>The <b>View Dependencies Graph</b> option from the Maestro
Eclipse Integration (Maven 2) menu displays a detailed, graphical
representation of project dependencies. The graph includes several
options that allows you to adjust how the graph appears, as explained
below.</p>
<p>To display the dependencies graph:</p>
<ol>
	<li>In the <b>Package Explorer</b> window, right-click on the
	folder that contains your project, then select <b>Maven 2</b> to
	display the Maven 2 Menu options.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>View Dependencies</b> option. After a few
	seconds, a window appears, showing the dependencies graph.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Dependency Graph Representation</h4>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td width="200"><b>Box Color</b></td>
		<td width="400"><b>Representation</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Green</td>
		<td>Represents the project. It is displayed in the center.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Blue</td>
		<td>Runtime dependencies.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Dark Yellow</td>
		<td>Test-scope dependencies.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yellow</td>
		<td>Selected dependency.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The arrows between boxes show the dependencies including the
version. Thicker lines represent direct dependencies, while the thinner
ones represent transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies)
for the project.</p>
<p>It is possible to reorder the boxes by using drag and drop.</p>
