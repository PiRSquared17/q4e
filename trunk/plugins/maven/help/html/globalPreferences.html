<h3>Setting Global Preferences</h3>
</head>

<body>
<p>The Eclipse Integration plugin uses the Eclipse Preferences page
to let you set both global and archetype (per-project) preferences that
remain in place for all (and future) Eclipse executions until you change
them again. Global preferences you can set include whether you want to
download source and JavaDocs or work offline, while the archetype
preference lets you specify a new archetype source list URL for a
project. The following sections contain instructions for setting the
global preferences, as well as setting, editing, and deleting new
archetype source list URLs.</p>
<ol>
	<li>From the Eclipse main menu, select <b>Window > Preferences</b>
	to display the <b>Eclipse Preferences</b> window.</li>
	<li>In the left part of the window, click to highlight <b>Maven</b>,
	which causes the <b>Maven preference</b> options to appear in the right
	side of the window.<br />
	The following table describes each of the available <b>Maven
	Preference</b> options.<br />
	<i>If you double-click to expand Maven, <b>Archetype Preference</b>
	appears. That option lets you set archetype preferences, as explained
	in the section entitled, “<a href="archetypeList.html">Setting
	Archetype List URL Preferences</a>.”</i>
