<h3>Force Version</h3>
</head>

<body>
<p>The <b>Force Version</b> option utilizes Maven's <<code>dependencyManagement</code>>
section of the project's <code>pom.xml</code> to ensure that the version
of the selected artifact is a specific version or a version within a
certain range.</p>
<p>To select a specific version for an artifact:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Right click on the selected artifact and select <b>Force
	Version</b> from the menu.</li>
	<li>A popup will be displayed with the list of all the other
	versions present in the dependency tree. Select the version to use or
	type the version range in the <b>Other</b> text field. <br />
	The item marked as <b>Currently Selected</b> is the version that Maven
	has currently resolved.</li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b>. <br />
	Selecting <b>Cancel</b> will cancel the operation without making any
	changes to the project's <code>pom.xml</code>.</li>
</ol>
