<p>The <b>Q for Eclipse</b> is a plugin that better integrates the
development and building processes by allowing users to run Maven
commands inside of the Eclipse IDE.</p>

<h2>Installing and Uninstalling the Eclipse Integration Plugin</h2>
<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Eclipse 3.3 or greater, which you can find at <a
		href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads</a></li>
	<li>Java 5, which you can find at <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com</a>
	<br />
	<i>Java 5 must be the JDK version, not JRE. If you experience build
	errors, even if the JDK is first in your path, start Eclipse with "<code>-vm
	c:\%JAVA_HOME%\bin\javaw.exe</code>" , where <code>JAVA_HOME</code> is set to
	your JDK installation directory. This option can be put in the
	eclipse.ini file and then you can start Eclipse from your menu or
	shortcut.</i></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="installation">Installing Q for Eclipse</a></h3>
<ol>
	<li>On the menu bar, click <b>Help > Software Updates > Find
	and Install</b>. An installation wizard opens.</li>
	<li>In the <b>Feature Updates</b> window:
	<ul>
		<li>Select <b>Search for new features to install</b> if this is
		the first time you have installed the plugin.</li>
		<li>Select <b>Search for updates</b> if you already have a
		version of the plugin installed and are just performing an upgrade.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>On the <b>Update sites to visit</b> page, click the <b>New
	Remote Site</b> button (located on the right side). A small pop-up appears,
	allowing you to set up a bookmark for the site from which you will
	download the Q for Eclipse Integration Plugin.</li>
	<li>Enter a name or alias for the site from which you want to
	download the plugin (for example, “<code>Q for Eclipse</code>”). Then,
	enter the URL, <a
		href="http://q4e.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updatesite/">http://q4e.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updatesite/</a>,
	for the download site. <i>If you are behind a firewall that
	requires a proxy you must setup a proxy in Eclipse to reach the remote
	site. To setup a proxy go to <b>Window > Preferences</b> and in the new
	window select <b>Network Connections</b> located under <b>General</b>
	in the left hand expandable menu to establish a <b>Manual Proxy
	Configuration</b>.</i></li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b> to add the new site to the list of sites in
	the window of the wizard.</li>
	<li>Click the box to select the site you just added, then click <b>Finish</b>.
	Eclipse then searches the site for available features you can install
	and and displays them in hierarchical tree structure on a <b>Search
	Results</b> page.</li>
	<li>On the <b>Search Results</b> page, click to select the box to
	the left of the feature(s) you want to install (including the <code>Q
	for Eclipse</code> plugin). Then, below the list of features, click to select
	<b>Show the latest version of a feature only</b>.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Next</b> to display the </b>Feature License</b> screen of the
	wizard. The <b>Feature License</b> screen shows a list of the features
	you selected that have license agreements you must accept before
	installing them. Below the list window, click the first option to
	indicate you accept the license agreement(s), then click <b>Next</b> to
	move to the <b>Installation</b> screen of the wizard.</li>
	<li>The <b>Installation</b> screen lists all of the
	features/plugins you have chosen to install, along with the
	corresponding directories into which they will install:
	<ul>
		<li>If you want to accept the default destination directories
		shown for the features you selected,
		<ol>
			<li>Click <b>Finish</b> to download the features/plugins.</li>
			<li>After downloading, a <b>Feature Verification</b> screen will
			appear.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>If you want to change the default destination directories
		shown for the features you selected,
		<ol>
			<li>Click to highlight the feature whose destination you want to
			change.</li>
			<li>Click the <b>Change Location</b> button, specify the new
			destination, then click <b>OK</b>.</li>
			<li>After downloading, a <b>Feature Verification</b> screen will
			appear.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>On the <b>Feature Verification</b> screen, verify that you
	want to install the features you selected. To install all of the
	features, click <b>Install All</b>.</li>
	<li>When installation is complete, a window appears asking you
	whether you would like to restart Eclipse. Click <b>Yes</b> to restart
	so the new features will take effect.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="verification">Verifying Installation</a></h3>
<ol>
	<li>After Eclipse has been restarted, click on <b>Help > About
	Eclipse SDK</b>.</li>
	<li>On the pop-up, click <b>Plug-in Details</b>. A list of all
	plugins installed on Eclipse will appear.</li>
	<li>Scroll down and look for the Maestro Eclipse Integration
	Plugin you just installed by looking for the Provider name of DevZuz.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="uninstallation">Uninstalling the Eclipse
Integration Plugin</a></h3>
<h4>Uninstalling the Plugin</h4>
<p>The uninstall process completely removes the Eclipse Integration
Plugin from your computer.</p>
<ol>
	<li>From inside Eclipse, select <b>Help > Software Updates >
	Manage Configuration</b>.</li>
	<li>A list of plugins is listed in the left pane of the <b>Product
	Configuration</b> window. Select <b>Q for Eclipse</b> and right-click.</li>
	<li>Click on <b>Uninstall</b>, and the system automatically
	uninstalls the version you selected.</li>
	<li>Repeat this operation for each plugin you want to remove. Most
	likely you will want to remove the enabling features that were
	installed as part of the Q for Eclipse Integration Plugin as well:
	Apache Commons Collections, Prefuse, and Apache Maven.<br />
	<i>Uninstalling the plugin will require you to restart Eclipse.
	Restart Eclipse for the changes to take effect.</i></li>
</ol>

<h4>Returning to a Previous Installation</h4>
<p>Under Eclipse's <b>Manage Configuration</b> page, there are
several very useful options, such as <b>View Installation History</b>
and <b>Revert to Previous</b>. <b>View Installation History</b> shows a
log of all previous installations, and <b>Revert to Previous</b> lets
you choose to return to a specific, previous installation (for example,
the installation just prior to an upgrade). To return to a previous
installation:</p>
<ol>
	<li>From inside Eclipse, select <b>Help > Software Updates >
	Manage Configuration</b>. The <b>Product Configuration</b> screen appears,
	showing a list of components on the left side and a list of links on
	the right side.</li>
	<li>On the right side of the <b>Product Configuration</b> screen,
	click on the link for <b>Revert to Previous</b> to see a list of the
	previous installations organized by date and time.</li>
	<li>Click to select the installation to which you want to return.</li>
	<li>Select <b>Revert to Previous</b>. The system automatically
	returns to the installation and configuration that corresponds to your
	selection.<br />
	<i>This option is very useful if you have a problem with the
	upgrade procedure and want to return to the version you had before.</i></li>
</ol>
