<h3>Importing Maven 2 Projects</h3>
</head>

<body>
<p>The Eclipse IDE includes an <b>Import Wizard</b> that lets you
import projects of different types, but did not provide for Maven 2
projects. To import a Maven 2 project, you had to issue a command from
inside the project you wanted to import (the <code>mvn
eclipse:eclipse</code> command) prior to importing it. This command would take
the Maven project and generate the necessary Eclipse project files.
However, the new version of the Eclipse Integration plugin lets you use
the Eclipse Import Wizard to import Maven 2 projects without having to
execute the <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse</code> goal.</p>
<p>To import a Maven 2 project or projects:</p>

<ol>
	<li>From the Eclipse main menu, select <b>File > Import</b> to
	display the <b>Import Wizard</b>. The <b>Import Wizard</b> shows a
	window in which you can select the import source.</li>
	<li>Click to expand the <b>General</b> input source (if it is not
	already expanded). Then, double-click on <b>Maven 2 Project</b> to
	display the <b>Maven 2 Project Import</b> window.</li>
	<li>Click on the <b>Browse</b> button, then locate the directory
	that contains the Maven 2 project or projects you want to import. After
	you select the project directory, the available Maven 2 projects appear
	in the <b>Import Wizard</b> window.</li>
	<li>Click to select the box in front of the project or projects
	you want to import. On the right side of the <b>Import Wizard</b>
	window are buttons that provide additional functionality when you are
	selecting your project or projects for import. The table, below,
	explains the different ways you can select, deselect, or refresh the
	list of projects.
	<h4>Options in the Maven 2 Import Wizard Window</h4>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td width="350"><b>If:</b></td>
			<td width="350"><b>Then:</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>you want to select more than one project for import,</td>
			<td>click the box in front of each project.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>you want to select all projects that display in the <b>Import
			Wizard</b> window,</td>
			<td>click on the <b>Select All</b> button on the right side of
			the <b>Wizard</b> window.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>deselect a single project,</td>
			<td>click to remove the check mark from its selection box.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>deselect all projects you selected,</td>
			<td>click the <b>Deselect</b> button on the right side of the <b>Wizard</b>
			window.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>refresh to display additional projects in the project
			directory,</td>
			<td>click on the <b>Refresh</b> button on the right side of the
			<b>Wizard</b> window.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</li>
	<li>After you have selected the project or projects you want to
	import, click on the <b>Finish</b> button. The system imports the Maven
	2 project or projects, which then appear in the <b>Package Explorer</b>
	window. Corresponding confirmation messages appear in the message
	window at the bottom of the screen.</li>
