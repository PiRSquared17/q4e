<h3>Analyse Dependencies View</h3>
</head>

<body>
<p>The Analyse Dependencies tab is divided into three sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Instances Pane</b> is at the left side section of the tab.
	This shows the tree of transitive dependencies. Each item in the tree
	is an instance of a dependency, and a given dependency may appear many
	times in the same tree. Selecting an item in this pane will highlight
	the corresponding version and artifact in the other panes.</li>
	<li><b>Versions Pane</b> is at the top right section of the tab.
	This shows a sortable list of all dependencies including the version of
	the artifact. The <b>Instances</b> column shows a count of the number
	of times that a given dependency appears in the dependency tree.
	Selecting an item in this pane will highlight the corresponding
	instances in the Instances Pane and artifact in the Artifacts Pane.</li>
	<li><b>Artifacts Pane</b> is at the bottom right section of the
	tab. This shows a sortable list of all dependencies without the version
	information. The versions column indicates the number of different
	versions of that artifact in the dependency tree, which is very useful
	for finding artifacts with more than one version. Selecting an item in
	this pane will highlight the corresponding versions and instances in
	the other panes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following describes the selection type and the highlighting
colors associated with it:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Primary Selection</b>: The item selected in any of the
	three panes. This is highlighted in orange.</li>
	<li><b>Secondary Selection</b>: These are the items that are
	related to your Primary Selection. For example if you select a
	particular version from the <b>Versions Pane</b>, the related items are
	the corresponding artifacts in the <b>Artifacts Pane</b> and the
	instances of that version in the <b>Instances Pane</b>. This is
	highlighted in yellow.</li>
	<li><b>Tertiary Selection</b>: These items represent the parent
	instances of the currently selected instances. They indicate the path
	from the tree root to the selected instances. These only appear in the
	Instances Pane and are highlighted in light yellow.</li>
</ul>
