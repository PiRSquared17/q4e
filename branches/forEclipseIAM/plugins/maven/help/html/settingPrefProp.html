<p>The Eclipse Integration plugin uses the Eclipse Preferences page
to let you set both global and archetype (per-project) preferences that
remain in place for all (and future) Eclipse executions until you change
them again.</p>
<p>Global preferences you can set include whether you want to
download source and JavaDocs or work offline, while the archetype
preference lets you specify a new archetype source list URL for a
project. The following sections contain instructions for setting the
global preferences, as well as setting, editing, and deleting new
archetype source list URLs.</p>
