= Introduction =

After the development has moved to the Eclipse Foundation the new project Eclipse IAM had to introduce some changes, specifically naming, that require a little more work to upgrade than usual.


= Upgrading from Q4E to Eclipse IAM =


Eclipse IAM builds are still published in the Q4E update site for the time being.

 * Uninstall previous versions of Q4E
  * Help - Software Updates - Installed software
  * Select all entries starting with "Q for Eclipse" and the one "Pom XML Editor Feature"
  * Click uninstall
 * Install Eclipse IAM
  * Developer builds are already at http://q4e.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updatesite-dev

Eclips IAM will recognize Q4E projects automatically, no need to import them again.
