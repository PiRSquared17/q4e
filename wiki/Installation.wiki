= Update site =

*Q4E is now [http://www.eclipse.org/iam/ Eclipse IAM]*

Releases will still be published in this site until full migration to the Eclipse Foundation happens.

*If you had Q4E version 0.8.1 or lower read the [UpgradingToEclipseIAM Upgrading to Eclipse IAM instructions]*

==`http://q4e.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updatesite-iam/`==

We recommend installing into _Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers_ as it already includes most of the dependencies.

Go to Help - Software Updates - Available Software

Click on _Manage Sites - Add_ and add the Eclipse IAM update site at `http://q4e.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updatesite-iam/`

Also add the following Update Sites, or make sure they are checked in the _Manage Sites_ screen, depending on your version of Eclipse

We suggest the installation of the [http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/ Web Tools Platform] XML editor so you can benefit from auto completion, error checking,... while editing the pom.xml files.

You can install it from the Eclipse Update site that you should already have in your  sites list, or following the instructions in the [http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/ WTP downloads page]
