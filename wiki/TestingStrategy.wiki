Some Useful Testing Strategy

= Introduction =

One of the "cleaner" ways to test this project
without polluting your main eclipse distribution 
is to add an extension location and putting the 
q4e plugins there.

Without an extension location, the q4e plugins are 
installed in your eclipse distribution directory
which means it will be placed alongside the main eclipse
plugins. 

The advantage of this approach is to enable you to
turn on/turn off the q4e installation and be easily able to 
delete it when you want to test a new version.
