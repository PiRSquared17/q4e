= Features in Q for Eclipse *core* =

== Maven suggestions in the XML editor ==
  When editing `pom.xml` files, values for the !GroupId, !PackageId and Version tags when adding a dependency are available.

  This feature uses the Open Artifact Search Framework outlined below.

== Always updated dependencies ==
  No need to `mvn install` the dependencies on the workspace when running maven goals. The most current version is always used.

  This means that you can modify a project on your workspace and use it in the surefire tests of a different one depending on it. Instantly. 

== Profile activation/deactivation == 
  The profile view allows for quickly enabling and disabling profiles when running maven.

== Open Artifact Search Framework ==
  New extension points allow third parties to develop and register search engines for their indexing solution.

  Several implementations are bundled with the install so you can use it out of the box.

= WTP support =

== J2EE Project Dependencies management ==
  Automatic synchronization of J2EE project dependencies from maven dependencies for war projects.

  All your dependencies in the workspace will be available when running the project on a J2EE server. No more `ClassNotFoundException` for you.
