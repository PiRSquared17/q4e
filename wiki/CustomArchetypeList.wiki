#summary How to create a new archetype list.
#labels Phase-Support

= Introduction =

Q4E comes configured with a default archetype list provider (the _Wiki Provider_), which uses the contents of this wiki page (more precisely, the source form of the page) to create the list of available archetypes presented by the new maven project wizard.

The _Wiki Provider_ can be configured for accessing other URLs, so you can provide your own list of archetypes. Currently, only `http://` and `https://` urls are suported, but starting with 0.3.0, also `file://` urls will be valid.


= Creating the archetype list =

The format understood by the _Wiki Provider_ is the following:

{{{
<br>| Artifact Id | Group Id | Version | Repository | Description |
<br>| Artifact Id 2 | Group Id 2 | Version 2 | Repository 2 | Description 2 |
...
<br>| Artifact Id n | Group Id n | Version n | Repository n | Description n |
}}}

*Note:* The `<br>` must be typed literally at the start of every line, and the first pipe must be just after it, without whitespace in between.

For example:
{{{
<br>|my-artifact|my.group|1.1|[http://my.repo.com/is/cool]|My nice description|
<br>|my-other-artifact|my.group|3.1|[http://my.repo.com/is/cool]|Brief description|
}}}

= Configuring a new _Wiki Provider_ =
Once your archetype list is complete and has been made accessible at a given URL, the next step is to tell q4e about that url.

For this example, let's suppose it is in my personal web at `http://localhost/~amuino/arch.txt`.

Open Eclipse preferences and navigate to _Maven > Archetype Preferences_.

Here you can add a new archetype list using the _New..._ button. _Edit..._ will let you edit an existing list. And, of course, you can delete a list simply by selecting it and pressing _Remove_.

Let's add the new list. Press _New..._.

The dialog allows selecting an URL where the list can be found and its type (or format).

Currently, the only available type is _Wiki Provider_.

To complete the example, type the location of your list (`http://localhost/~amuino/arch.txt`) and press _Ok_.

Done! Now you're ready for creating a new maven project using the archetypes on your list.
